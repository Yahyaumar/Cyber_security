# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Incidents Data Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning pipeline on cybersecurity incident data. The dataset contains detailed records of global cyber attacks, categorized by country, year, attack type, industry sector, and more. The goal is to extract insights, visualize trends, and build predictive models for cyber incident classification.

📌 Project Objectives
Perform data preprocessing and cleaning.

Explore global trends in cybersecurity incidents.

Visualize attack types and affected sectors.

Identify countries most targeted by attacks.

Apply classification models to predict attack types.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains:

Country: Location where the incident occurred.

Year: Incident year.

Attack Type: Classification of the cyberattack (e.g., malware, ransomware).

Sector: Targeted industry or sector (e.g., government, finance).

Losses, Records Lost, and other relevant indicators.

🔍 Data Analysis & Visualization
Heatmaps, bar plots, and pie charts to show:

Top countries affected by cyber attacks.

Sector-wise attack distribution.

Year-wise trend of cybersecurity incidents.

Correlation analysis among key numerical fields.

🤖 Machine Learning
Models Used:
Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
